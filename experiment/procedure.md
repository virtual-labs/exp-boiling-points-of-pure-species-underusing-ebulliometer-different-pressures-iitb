## Procedure

1. Purge the System with Nitrogen gas to remove contaminants.
    1. Open the outlet of ebulliometer.
    2. Start Nitrogen Gas.
    3. Allow gas to flow through the system for few minutes.
    4. Shut off nitrogen supply after pop up massage for purging completion is displayed.
2. Generating boiling point data at Atmospheric pressure.
    1. Select the system/compound from the dropdown list.
    2. Close the outlet of ebulliometer and open the inlet.
    3. Close the inlet of ebulliometer after it is filled.
    4. Start cold water pump.
    5. Start Heating coil.
    6. Increase heating rate slowly by moving the sliding bar.
    7. Allow system to accommodate change in the heat.
    8. Observe the change in drop rate and temperature.
    9. Again, increase heating rate slowly until drop rate and temperature become constant.
    10. Do the same until small increment in heating rate won’t rising temperature.
    11. Note Down the temperature and pressure as a first reading.

3. Generating boiling point data at sub-atmospheric pressure.
    1. Adjust the heating rate to maintain drop rate around 65 drops per min.
    2. Start the Vacuum pump.
    3. Stop vacuum pump at desired manometer height difference.
    4. Calculate pressure based on manometer value.
    5. Again, increase heating rate slowly until drop rate and temperature become constant.
    6. Do the same until small increment in heating rate won’t rising temperature.
    7. Note Down the temperature and pressure as a second reading.
    8. Repeat task 3 for at least 5 times.
