<h3> Purge the System with Nitrogen gas to remove contaminants. </h3>
<ol type='1'>
<li> Open the outlet of ebulliometer. </li>
<li> Start Nitrogen Gas. </li>
<li> Allow gas to flow through the system for few minutes. </li>
<li> Shut off nitrogen supply after pop up   massage for purging completion is displayed. </li>
</ol>

<h3>Generating boiling point data at Atmospheric pressure. </h3>
<ol type='1'>
<li>Select the system/compound from the dropdown list. </li>
<li>Close the outlet of ebulliometer and open the inlet. </li>
<li>Close the inlet of ebulliometer after it is filled. </li>
<li>Start cold water pump. </li>
<li>Start Heating coil. </li>
<li>Increase heating rate slowly by moving the sliding bar. </li>
<li>Allow system to accommodate change in the heat. </li>
<li>Observe the change in drop rate and temperature. </li>
<li>Again, increase heating rate slowly until drop rate and temperature become constant. </li>
<li>Do the same until small increment in heating rate won’t rising temperature. </li>
<li>Note Down the temperature and pressure as a first reading. </li>
</ol>

<h3> Generating boiling point data at sub-atmospheric pressure. </h3>
<ol type='1'>
<li>Adjust the heating rate to maintain drop rate around 65 drops per min. </li>
<li>Start the Vacuum pump. </li>
<li>Stop vacuum pump at desired manometer height difference. </li>
<li>Calculate pressure based on manometer value. </li>
<li>Again, increase heating rate slowly until drop rate and temperature become constant. </li>
<li>Do the same until small increment in heating rate won’t rising temperature. </li>
<li>Note Down the temperature and pressure as a second reading. </li>
<li>Repeat task 3 for at least 5 times. </li>
</ol>
